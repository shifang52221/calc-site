  "quick": {
   "q1": "Measure each wall (width x height) and add them. If you're also painting the ceiling, estimate ceiling area separately because it often uses different paint and coverage. Subtract only large openings if you want a tighter estimate; for most rooms your buffer covers doors and typical windows.",
   "q2": "Choose coats honestly. Two finish coats is common for new colors, patched walls, and big color changes. Primer is its own step: it can reduce finish coats or help stains, but it does not replace paint volume, and you still need to buy enough finish paint for the coats you plan.",
   "q3": "Use realistic coverage, not ideal label numbers. Texture, porous drywall, and deep colors can cut coverage, and cutting-in around trim adds extra brushwork. If you're unsure, assume a lower coverage rate so you don't run out mid-wall and end up with lap marks or a mismatched batch.",

   "a2": "It depends on load, base preparation, and local requirements. Many walkways are around 4 inches, while driveways are often thicker and may have thicker edges, and heavy loads (RVs, dumpsters) can require more. If your slab must drain, thickness can vary across the slope—use the average thickness for volume and confirm the minimum thickness at the thinnest edge (project dependent).",

   "q1": "Is 10% waste enough for ceiling drywall?",
   "a1": "Often yes for simple rectangular rooms with few cutouts, especially if you plan sheet layout. If the ceiling has many lights/vents, angled edges, tray details, or lots of small sections, 15% is a safer starting point. The more cutouts and offcuts you create, the harder it is to reuse scraps effectively (project dependent).",
   "q2": "What size drywall (sheetrock) for a ceiling: 1/2\" or 5/8\"?",
   "a2": "It depends on joist spacing, sag resistance needs, and local code. Many ceilings use 1/2\" in common conditions, while 5/8\" is often used for better sag resistance and some fire-rated assemblies. If you're matching existing construction, confirm what is already installed so transitions stay flush (project dependent).",
   "q3": "Does sheet size change the total number of sheets?",
   "a3": "Yes. Different sheet sizes create different seam locations and different cutoff patterns, which changes how much waste you generate. If you are not planning a detailed layout, use a slightly higher waste factor to cover cutoff risk, especially in rooms where ceiling dimensions do not divide neatly into 4-foot widths."

   "a1": "Often yes for appearance and moisture retention, especially as a refresh layer. For better weed suppression, many beds use closer to 3 inches, but you should still keep mulch thinner right at plant crowns and trunks. If weeds are the main issue, bed prep (weeding and edging) matters as much as depth (project dependent).",
   "q2": "How much more mulch is 3 inches vs 2 inches?",
   "a2": "About 50% more volume for the same area because 3 inches is 1.5 times the depth of 2 inches. For example, if 2 inches requires 2 cubic yards, 3 inches will be about 3 cubic yards for the same bed area (before buffers and settling).",
   "q3": "Should I remove old mulch first?",
   "a3": "Not always. If the old layer is thin and in good shape, you can top it up. If it is thick, matted, or mixed with soil and weeds, removing some can prevent excess buildup and improve air and water movement. Also consider whether old mulch has accumulated year after year to a depth that is no longer healthy for the plants."

   "q2": "Should I include sand in a soil mix?",
   "a2": "Sometimes. Sand is often used in leveling mixes and in certain drainage-focused blends, but adding sand to the wrong native soil can create an undesirable texture. Use sand intentionally (for a specific purpose) and follow local guidance for your plants and soil type (project dependent).",
